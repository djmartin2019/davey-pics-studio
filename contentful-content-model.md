## Setting Up Content

4. Add several categories (e.g., Birds, Landscapes, Wildlife, etc.)
5. Add several gallery items with appropriate metadata
6. Create at least one gallery collection with multiple photos
7. Create several blog posts with rich content

## Tips for Rich Text Content

- Use headings appropriately (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include images within the rich text where appropriate
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for better readability
- Link to other blog posts or external resources when relevant
- Add image captions for better context

## Image Optimization

- Upload high-quality images (the Next.js app will handle optimization)
- Include descriptive titles and alt text for all images
- Consider the aspect ratio for different image placements
- For gallery items, maintain consistent dimensions for a cleaner layout
